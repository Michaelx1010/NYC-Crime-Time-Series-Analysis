## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting violent crime trends in New York City using advanced time series analysis and machine learning techniques. By identifying temporal patterns, seasonal trends, and potential predictors, the study provides actionable insights to inform policy decisions and enhance public safety.

---

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:
1. To model and forecast violent crime incidents in NYC using time series analysis.
2. To uncover significant trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
3. To evaluate the impact of external factors on crime rates using advanced modeling approaches.
4. To create effective visualizations that communicate insights to stakeholders.

## Methods and Tools

### Time Series Analysis
- **ARIMA/SARIMA Models**: Capturing temporal dependencies and seasonal patterns.
- **ARIMAX/SARIMAX Models**: Incorporating exogenous variables to enhance forecasting accuracy.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Identifying cyclical trends and filtering noise.

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- **ARCH/GARCH Models**: Modeling volatility in crime rates.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **LSTMs**: Capturing complex temporal patterns in the data.

### Data Visualization
Interactive and static visualizations created using:
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Plotly**
